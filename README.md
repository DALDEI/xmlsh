xmlsh
=====

A command line shell for the new N(ot)O(nly) XML generation

The last stable version of xmlsh is 1.3.1.  See the xmlsh1_3 github branch: https://github.com/DALDEI/xmlsh1_3


This GitHub repository is for the development of xmlsh 2.0.  It is currently IN-DEVELOPMENT.
You are welcome to use it, and I attempt to keep the mainline reasonably stable, but I have not reached the point where the syntax is frozen.  I expect further changes that will affect backwards and forwards compatibilty to some extent.
I have also not started on the updated documentation -- volunteers welcome.
I would like to move to a annotation based inline docmenation for commands and functions rather then external XML files.
